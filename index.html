            <h2>WELCOME TO THE WALE RESORT</h2>
                <p>Infinity Resorts first started in 1991 with a vision to create a brand of wildlife resorts offering 
                    our guests the opportunity to enjoy the stunning biodiversity of India while in the lap of luxury. 
                    Subsequently we formed “Conservation Corporation of India Pvt. Ltd” (CCIPL) which owns the “Infinity
                     Resorts” brand name. Today, Infinity Resorts has presence in world-renowned Tiger Reserves located
                      at Jim Corbett (Uttarakhand), Kaziranga (Assam), Kanha and Bandhavgarh (Madhya Pradesh) & a quaint
                       farm at the famous Rann of Kutch (Gujarat).
